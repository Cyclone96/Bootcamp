QUIZ
1.	Compose a program that creates a one-dimensional array containing exactly 1000 integers, and then attempts to access a[1000]. What happens when you run the program?
a.	1000
b.	Value of the array at the start
c.	 Value of the array at the end
d.	Indexing error
Ans: Indexing error

2.	What is wrong with the following code fragment?
a = []
for I in range(10):
a[i] = i * i
Ans: a is an empty in the listing. This implies that if it’s called, a run-time error will pop.


3.	What does the following code fragment write?
a = stdarray.createID(10, 0)
for i in range(10):
a[i] = 9 – i
for i in range(10):
a[i] = a[a[i]]
for v in a:
stdio.writeIn(v)

Ans: It’s a NameError because the stdarray on the first line isn’t defined


4.	What is a[] after executing the following code fragment?
n = 10
a = [0, 1]
for I in range(2, n):
a += [a[i-1] + a[i - 2]]
Ans: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
